          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">1. Acceptance of Terms</h3>
          <p>
            By accessing and using the website of Churchtown Media ("we", "our", or "us"), located at churchtownmedia.co.uk, you accept and agree to be bound by the terms and provisions of this agreement. If you do not agree with any part of these terms, you must not use our website or services.
          </p>
          <p>
            These Terms of Service apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use our website, as well as clients who engage our professional services.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">2. Services</h3>
          <p>
            Churchtown Media provides web design, web development, search engine optimisation (SEO), content marketing, and related digital services to businesses across the North West and wider United Kingdom.
          </p>
          <p>
            All professional services are subject to a separate service agreement or proposal, which will be provided and agreed upon before any work commences. Proposals include scope of work, timelines, deliverables, and payment terms specific to each project. Verbal agreements are not binding until confirmed in writing.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">3. Quotes and Payment</h3>
          <p>
            All quotes provided by Churchtown Media are valid for 30 days unless otherwise stated. We require a 50% deposit before commencing work, with the remaining balance due upon project completion or as outlined in the service agreement. Payment plans of 3-6 months are available for qualifying projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            Late payments may incur interest at 8% above the Bank of England base rate in accordance with the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998. We reserve the right to suspend services where invoices remain unpaid beyond 14 days of the due date.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">4. Intellectual Property</h3>
          <p>
            The content, layout, design, data, databases, and graphics on this website are protected by United Kingdom and international copyright laws and are the property of Churchtown Media unless otherwise stated. You agree not to copy, reproduce, distribute, or republish any content without our prior written permission.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon full payment, clients receive full ownership of all custom code, designs, and assets produced for their project. We retain the right to showcase completed work in our portfolio unless a non-disclosure agreement is in place. Third-party assets (stock images, fonts, plugins) remain subject to their respective licences.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">5. Client Responsibilities</h3>
          <p>
            Clients are responsible for providing accurate content, images, and feedback in a timely manner. Delays in providing materials may result in extended timelines. We assume all content provided to us by the client is owned by or licensed to the client and does not infringe upon any third-party rights.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">6. Limitation of Liability</h3>
          <p>
            In no event shall Churchtown Media be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from your access to or use of (or inability to access or use) our website or services.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our total liability for any claim arising from our services shall not exceed the total amount paid by the client for the specific project in question. We do not guarantee specific SEO rankings or traffic results, though we work diligently to achieve the best possible outcomes.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">7. Cancellation and Refunds</h3>
          <p>
            Either party may terminate a service agreement with 30 days written notice. If a project is cancelled after commencement, the client is responsible for payment of all work completed to date. Deposits are non-refundable once work has begun. We offer a 30-day satisfaction guarantee on completed websites — if you are not satisfied, we will revise the work at no additional cost.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">8. Third-Party Links</h3>
          <p>
            Our website may contain links to third-party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by Churchtown Media. We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party websites or services.
          </p>
          
          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">9. Governing Law</h3>
