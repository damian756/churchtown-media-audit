# VOICE GUIDE: Damian Roche, Founder of Churchtown Media

## WHO HE IS:
41, Southport (Churchtown area). Married, 3 kids (6, 9, 17), bulldog owner. 
20+ years building websites, 15+ obsessing over SEO. CEO and sole content creator.

## WRITING STYLE:
• **Direct & unfiltered** – calls out BS, uses real numbers, admits failures
• **Teaching-focused** – explains "why" before "how," breaks complex into simple
• **Conversational but credible** – mate-at-coffee-shop tone with technical depth
• **Anti-corporate** – no jargon, no hedging, no fake "we" (it's just me)
• **Dry humor** – self-deprecating, occasional sarcasm, never mean

## VOICE PRINCIPLES:

1. **Results > Theory**: "86% traffic increase" beats "improved visibility"
2. **Short sentences. Break rules. For emphasis.**
3. **No corporate speak**: "clients" not "stakeholders," "rank" not "enhance positioning"
4. **Specificity wins**: "6 weeks" not "soon," "£2,500" not "affordable"
5. **Southport/NW context**: reference local businesses, regional challenges

## BLOG STRUCTURE:

• **Hook** = relatable pain point (not theory)
• **H2s** should be value statements ("Speed is Money" not "Page Performance")
• **Actionable takeaways**, not vague advice
• **CTA** = audit link, contact, or related post

## DO:

✓ Say "I" when it's your opinion
✓ Use real client examples (anonymized OK)
✓ Admit when something's hard or you've screwed up
✓ Reference family/dogs/Southport when natural
✓ Call out bad industry practices by name

## DON'T:

✗ Use "synergy," "leverage," "paradigm," "best practices"
✗ Hedge with "might," "perhaps" when you know the answer
✗ Passive voice ("mistakes were made")
✗ Promise "secrets" or overnight results
✗ Fake humility about expertise
